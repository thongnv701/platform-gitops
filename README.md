# Generic GitOps Platform Repository

This repository provides a template for managing Kubernetes infrastructure and application deployments using GitOps principles with ArgoCD and Helm. It is designed to help you deploy and manage any services or applications you want on your own Kubernetes cluster.

- `helm/`: Helm charts and values for each component or service you wish to deploy (e.g., argocd, cert-manager, monitoring, ingress controllers, databases, etc.)

## Usage
- Add or update Helm charts and manifests in the `helm/` and `apps/` directories for the services you want to deploy.
- Update values in the respective `values.yaml` files to configure deployments.
- Use ArgoCD to sync and manage application states from this repository.

## Requirements
- Kubernetes cluster
- ArgoCD
- Helm

## Notes
- Do not commit sensitive data or secrets to this repository.
- Use external secrets management solutions for credentials and keys.
